# Python Math Programs

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of mathematical functions and modules in Python.

## Program 1: Factorial Calculation

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Functionality
- The program defines a function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a given integer `n` using a loop.
- The function returns the factorial value.
- The main code calls the function with a sample number (for example, 5) and prints the result.

#### Example Output
```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Program 2: Calculate Square Root, Logarithm, and Sine

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the math module to calculate the:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### Functionality
- The program imports the `math` module.
- Takes a floating-point input from the user.
- Calculates the square root with `math.sqrt()`, the natural logarithm with `math.log()`, and the sine in radians with `math.sin()`.
- Prints all results.

#### Example Output
```
Enter a number: 2
Square root of 2 is: 1.4142135623730951
Natural logarithm of 2 is: 0.6931471805599453
Sine of 2 is: 0.9092974268256817
```
